Erasure of a people’s history, negation of trauma. Shadows and truth. 	First came the wars that led to other wars that led to the Secret War that became a proxy war in 1960s Laos, led by the Central Intelligence Agency. The white foreigner arrived bearing guns and bombs to lead his surrogate cause, to quell communism and use Hmong men to do his work of war. In breach of Laos’ neutral state and a deepening of secrets. 	1975. The war came crumbling down and all was lost to the communist victors of Vietnam and Laos. Almost everyone fled, deserting what was once home. 	Yellow rain came in the midst of exodus, poison landed on the Hmong in the middle of escape. Specks descending from aircraft overhead, falling onto trees, into water, and onto skin. Specks of a mysterious substance ranging in color: red, black, white, green, and yellow above all. Specks of illness and death. 	I am a daughter of Hmong refugees: mother and father were among the fled, which makes me among the fled. Second child and firstborn in a new land, daughter who keeps looking back at the sky.  Guide for the Channeling  	Toward a worn legacy  	of rain, I have been lost  	down every jungle path,  	adrift and senseless to  	split open a cascade of  	knowing. I have tried with  	all my limber to keen a  	credo of justice, shelter  	those who solace inside  	graves. I have been boiled  	in my bladed search,  	opening with questions  	of a deserted pain to end  	with a cemented breath  	shattered into silk. This is  	where I am taking you:  	into a discarded vista  	blowing forth a silent blaze.  	Here in sunk villages  	of the disregarded. Here  	where even the dirt of  	the land cannot muster  	against the threat of air.  	Biomedical, vegetation,  	munitions unfound, every  	footprint incarnate.  	Where highlands tangle  	their echoes to the ground.  	A place no matter how  	remote will always be  	too near and too much  	a reminder of an expired  	war. Refugees not called  	as people only to be  	called the outcome of an  	event. We are venturing  	into swell beyond swelling  	of paperwork and protocol,  	slips of memo and routing,  	cable and classified meeting.  	Here is the talk: biological  	weapon, yellow spots,  	apiary blame, for decades  	to wane and cold  	filed. Believe me as a  	torch of this wandering  	that I have been digging  	within the origins of  	redaction. Believe where  	I am sending you. I have  	been shoveling upside  	down. And now my eyes  	stagger, my hands ache,  	my legs becoming hunter,  	my back a raging shadow.  	I have been gardening myself  	into this remembrance.   Declassified  	May the dead     be ever-evidenced  	  May their clandestine names  	bellow from the mouth     of an August  	   monsoon     May they coax the truth  	from every storm  	       Long ago  	there lived a jungle  	   whose only cloth was    camouflage  	All those who came to it  	learned the burden of hiding  	        Long ago    we memorized  	the refrains of wild birds  	stitched them underneath  	our evacuated skins  	Then man     Then soldier  Then vividness  	    of saffron and canary  	arriving as small showers  	     divulging its anatomy  	to the ecosystem  	To keep the covert buried is not  	how this story bends  	The insects have always known  	Their lineage of pollen       and the children  	of insects know too  	May this Secret War  its author of poisons  	its professor of counterfeit treaties  	kidnapper of honeybees    each iota  	of its polluted doing  	may it all burn and blister  	under its own nakedness   The Fact of the Matter Is the Consequence of Ugly Deaths  	It’s not fair … to not consider … other stories … other frames of the story…. Ronald Reagan used this story to order the manufacture of chemical weapons … first time in twenty years. If the United States were to manufacture chemical weapons again … use them because the Russians supposedly had … people would have died ugly deaths in the consequence. 	—Robert Krulwich, Radiolab/WNYC, September 23, 2012  	Out here, it’s parlors of jungle.  	Sometimes flashbacks  	Of disfigured interrogations,  	Handprints fleeing  	To leave no crease  	Behind.  	This is our monsoon  	To shelter, our version  	 Of mortality snaking toward  	  Delusional truth.  	We know how to let go,  	Then perish  	With even more lineage of beauty.  	For thickening of truces  	Between false men,  	Aging purveyors of  	   Genetically modified diplomatics.  	Lizard citizens invented.  	   Herbicidal biomediation.  	Whistling riddles  	Into an arsenal of hammers.  	Spit of your unhinging.  	   You refuse our dead,  	As though  	We were never alive.  	Just say what you mean to say, that is:  	Hmong,  	Keep  	Your dying  	To yourself.   Anthem for Taking Back  	Even after    what shrivels  	on pillows  	are the syllables    of a dream  	and our braided furies huddle  	under porch light  	After skyline of lashes  	close over     our ocular machines  	and a lightlessness governs  	the way we move our arms  	Long from now  	how every breath    turns out  	a copy of the air before and all air  	moves through us    as cotton  	What we heed  	after a fluorescence capes  	the skin     of our early moon  	Whatever be the scourge  	  thumping inside our ears  	Ember our wings  	out of exile it says          ember loudly  	    all      of our furious tellings   They Think Our Killed Ones Cannot Speak to Us  	As if to adjourn all  	oxygen from the neck  	is how they try to take  	the voice   As if attempts  	to render us pale   Ripped  	lungless from woke into  	wild ash   As if ashes  	cannot blink howl testify  	with the pulse of their own  	tatters    As if hymn and  	whistle    Hail and pour  	We’ve seen how they  	shame the light  Stripped  	hollow tearing out  	filigrees of stars from  	protocols of dust to make  	drink a bouquet of venom  	sprayed down a constellation’s  	throat   They must be so  	earless as if we’ve no legs  	to kneel   We are each  	other’s memory of the  	future forty years from  	here   Arriving at ourselves  	by way of the dead  	History will not beget  	powder will not beget  	myth will not make us  	into marginalia   As ever  	possessed by what we  	have lost   There are no  	language barriers in the  	afterlife   A toxin is a  	toxin is a toxin is the man  	made truth is the dead who  	leave everything behind    	These bodies under the rains: vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory issues, chest pains, dizziness, blurred vision, blisters, and lesions. Cases of hemorrhaging and bloody diarrhea culminating in death. 	I think of them not only battling an enemy but also battling their own bodies. Then the unknowable. The truth buried in the jungles. How do you elude the shape of something you cannot name? 	Attacks came through the dry seasons and even at times during the wet, aimed primarily at remote areas like Phou Bia, a mountainous refuge for the Hmong resistance. In some cases, whole villages perished. The State Department reported more than 6,000 died from yellow rain. Some scholars and human rights organizations contend a larger number: possibly 20,000 to 40,000 Hmong casualties. 	Fingers were pointed at and allegations denied by the Soviet Union charged with backing the communist governments of Vietnam and Laos. 	Yellow rain had fallen before and would fall again, claims surfacing elsewhere: during the Yemeni civil war of 1963–67, against Khmer Rouge soldiers, attacks on mujahideen resistance fighters, Azerbaijan, Mozambique, the Iran-Iraq War.

Hmong refugees provided blood, urine, vomit, sputum, breast milk, leaves, twigs, rock scrapings, clothing, and a two-month-old aborted fetus, all sent to laboratories for testing. 	Then came shipping delays, specimens lost in transit, broken vials, backlogs of samples, and a lack of agency coordination. In this manmade confusion, the samples began to deteriorate. The government lacked the ability to fully test some of the specimens, so they rerouted samples to academic scientists. 	July 1981. Dr. Chester Mirocha at the University of Minnesota found on a leaf sample strange levels of trichothecene mycotoxins, a fatal substance that can grow naturally in crops and plants, or develop from fungi and mold. 	September 1981. Journalist Sterling Seagrave had written a book on yellow rain’s connection to mycotoxins, slated for publication on September 24. 	September 13, 1981. Less than two weeks before the book’s release, Secretary of State Alexander Haig unexpectedly told the press while in Berlin: the US had evidence to prove the Soviet Union and its allies violated the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) treaty by using biological weapons against refugees in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan. The treaty banned the storage, procurement, manufacture, and development of biological weapons or toxins, but failed to include compliance checks. The Geneva Protocol of 1925, a treaty forbidding the use of chemical and biological weapons, was also called into question. 	December 1981. Dr. Joseph Rosen at Rutgers University tested and found the same substance as Mirocha, along with what might have been polyethylene glycol, a synthetic ingredient perhaps used to strengthen the toxin and its delivery. 	1983 to 1986. The US sent to Southeast Asia a joint-agency team of State Department and Defense officials who found inconsistencies in the Hmong testimonies, stories told and then recanted.

ourselves to charade  	the arena of our work, serving  	death as an ode to scholarship,  	we wrote this doctrine of rain  	long before we knew the  	afterwar would need it.  	Rats and mice were

As when before you were born, it was sky times, we seemed to know our way around this labyrinth of air, drinking up seasons of the land with every new almanac of our lineage. We walked sensing our seamless cord to the roots above. It was always hard times but at least we were free, at least we could dream of you being free to live out the structures of your heart. But we are such a demographic of spirits in that our hearts have always been broken down through the path, such that now we are a scattering of evidence, siloed from the gravity that once held our knees firm to each other, such that we feed on the crumbs of our survival every time we go missing in beggary.

Above all, a supporter of the BWC and its pretense of peace. 	November 1982. The State Department announced at a press briefing the discovery of pollen in test samples, similar to the kind carried by honeybees. 	Early 1983. Meselson took a leaf sample he obtained from one scientist and gave it to another scientist, Dr. Joan Nowicke at the Smithsonian Institution, who discovered on it a variation of spots resembling pollen. 	April 1983. Meselson convened a conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to discuss yellow rain. There he met botanist Peter Ashton. Together they reached out to a bee expert at Yale University, Dr. Thomas Seeley, who said the spots were simply bee shit. Suddenly, Ashton noticed bee shit in his yard for the first time. Meselson, too, realized bee shit landed on people’s cars. 	May 31, 1983. Meselson announced at a conference that it was all just shit. No biological weapon here, they claimed. No BWC violation, they headlined. 	March 1984. Meselson and Seeley went to Thailand to research Southeast Asian honeybees. They placed paper on the jungle floor, then returned periodically to inspect it. Suddenly, the yellow spots appeared. These bees shit, they argued. Those who lobbied for arms-control could now depict a veneer of peace and the Soviets could claim innocence. 	They made the Hmong appear as if we were confused, as if we couldn’t tell the difference between what the earth gave and what man made, the difference between shit and death.  The Culpable  	When all else fails, you’ll indict the bees.  	When all else rushes at your awareness  	in the stage of sudden beasts,  	you’ll second guess  	if it had been the bees.  	You’ll claim the moonlight betrayed you,  	to know and see anything but only with a knife.  	When all else relents and you are kneeled for  	an answer,  	you’ll go back  	to spying on the bees,  	censuring their chorus the way you faulted  	us into outlaws, caught between  	hopeless and hopelessness,  	doubting us in the throat of your blame,  	saying malice to the grass, saying bees  	sired the venom  	that sired our lies that could  	sire another war.  	What fate tilted in your favor, counter  	the weight back to us.  	What fate tilted in your favor,  	counter  	the weight  	back to bees.   Sverdlovsk  	In 1979, an anthrax outbreak in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk led many Western security officials to conclude that the Soviets had been clandestinely developing biological weapons in violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention…. [T]he final death toll approached one thousand…. The response [the Soviets] took was direct: bad meat caused the Sverdlovsk deaths…. Granted clearance to look at a special CIA study of the Sverdlovsk events, and having heard the full brunt of the Soviet story, [Meselson] commented: “I spent many hours looking at classified material.

Migration of Bees: Resource Depletion, Seasonal Considerations 	[A. florea and A. andreniformis] in Thailand… abscond in response to increased exposure to heat/sunlight and during dearth… 	Absconding/migrations by thousands of colonies of A. dorsata coincide with the monsoon, which determines the dry and rainy seasons, hence the onset of resource depletion… 	The attacks occurred all throughout the year, although there were reduced numbers of attacks in Southeast Asia during the wet season. 	Bees abscond due to → dearth, heat, sunlight → indicating DRY season  	Most of the attacks happened during the DRY season  	↓  	But if the bees had already absconded during the DRY season  	↓  	Then what was causing the attacks?  	2. Elevation Considerations 	… colonies typically live in lofty communal nest sites … at relatively high elevation … during the dry season…. As forage decreases toward the end of the season, colonies abandon their combs and migrate to lower elevations, establishing new nests there for the mass flowering of the monsoon season. 	Bees are at high elevation → during the DRY season  	Bees change to low elevation → as WET season approaches  	The Hmong lived primarily at high elevation  	↓  	If bees moved to lower elevation during the WET season  	↓  	Why were there still  	↓  	Scattered attacks reported during the WET season?  	↓  	In places of higher elevation?  	3. Migration of Bees: Distance/Time Traveled  	After occupying a nest site for several months, all or most colonies abscond and travel to an alternative site, which may be 200 km away … 	A. dorsata very evidently move considerable distances in the course of migration. … [S]warms may take as much as a month to reach their final destination… along the way they frequently stop. 	Vast distances of 200 km +  	Month-long duration of bee movement +  	Bee feces showers +  	Hmong standing/running underneath feces showers +  	Exact timing ≈  	Not entirely impossible, but is most  	=  	Unlikely  	4. Migration of Bees: Stopover Sites/Bivouacs  	A. dorsata bivouacs [stopover sites during migration] found over two consecutive monsoon seasons congregated in and around a riverside mango grove in northern Thailand. 	Vast distances of 200 km +  	Month-long duration of bee movement +  	Bee bivouacking along the way +  	Bee feces showers +  	Hmong standing/running underneath feces showers +  	Exact timing =  	Too many poorly understood and scantily vetted variables  	≠  	Anything definitive  	5. Migration of Bees: Site Fidelity  	… same [bivouac] site was occupied in consecutive years, and knowledgeable field workers report that groups of giant honey bees gather there annually … I speculate that they have used trees on the site of the Mae Hong Son BCSS [bivouac congregation stopover site] for millennia. 	… migrating A. dorsata swarms are astonishingly faithful to their nest sites…. They may even return to the same eave or branch. It is not known how they do this, but the mechanism is probably related to chemical signatures left by the departing swarm and recognized by the returning swarm. 	Bees remain loyal to former nest sites  	↓  	Returning to them year after year, decade after decade  	↓  	If it had been the bees  	↓  	One should be able to visit an attack site today  	↓  	Look up in the trees, branches  	↓  	Find nests and hives within reasonable proximity  	=  	Find the bees  	+  	If no nests?  	=  	No bees  	6. Migration of Bees: Tree Preferences  	Bivouacs favored mango trees more…. Doubtless some tree species are more desirable than others. For example, though the BCSS was lined with tall Eucalyptus trees, I never saw a bivouac in this smooth-barked species, to which it may be difficult for bivouacs to cling. No clusters utilized nearby, numerous pomelo trees. Factors such as shade and angle of tree branches may be important… 	Bees prefer particular species of trees  	↓  	What kind of tree species grew where the attacks happened?  	7. Periodic Mass Flights: Distance to Nest Site 	In Nepal we also found (in April 1996) enormous amounts of yellow spots … accumulated at a distance of 30 m from the nests of A. dorsata. 	Which could mean  	↓↓↓  	If bees were the culprit  	↓  	Nests should be within vicinity =  	Attack sites  	8. Periodic Mass Flights: Frequency 	Colonies of A. dorsata perform varying numbers of short, daily periodic mass flights (PMFs) ranging in number from zero to six… 	Even in the warmest monsoon month in Delhi (in July 1984 at 48 degrees Celsius and high humidity rate) massed flight behavior happened periodically and the intensity and duration was similar to that in November. 	… defecation is another aspect of mass flight. 	Mass flight  	↓  	On a regular, daily basis  	↓  	To defecate, among other reasons  	↓  	[A. dorsata in other parts of Asia → mass flights  	even during the WET season → just as much as during the DRY season]  	↓  	So if bees defecate year round on constant, regular basis  	↓  	Reports of yellow rain attacks should have also happened year round  	↓  	On constant, regular basis  	↓  	But they did not  	Bees actively defecating +  	Even during the WET season ≠  	Consistent, steady reports of attacks every month of every year  	≠  	Death by naturally occurring phenomenon  	≠  	The bees   Prayer to the Redwood  	Senescent and dwelling  	In your tower with sorrel  	For shoes, I come to you fleshed  	With intention,  	A muted engine  	Dismantled at your coastal throne,  	In doubt and daring  	Intuit from you:  	Tell me if you’ve  	Heard of the Apis dorsata and I  	Will affirm  	What I know of its innocence.  	Take this confession to your  	Wildlife, mahogany limbs  	Grasping the upper  	Avenues of your genius memory  	As readily there a  	Nursery for hemlock and new firs.  	How would you have guarded your pine?  	These sudden flecks, you would have  	Known its taste as factory-born far from organic consent,  	You would have deemed its  	False footprint.  	Here in your globe’s  	Fluent echo, you exhale the words:  	Stockpile, degrade, human subjects.  	I make sentient  	My palm over your bark of suede,  	Dense as it were to defy  	A passing inferno.  	Stockpile, degrade, human subjects.  	No secret must ever be singed of your knowing.   Allied with the Bees  	These people have been living in these areas for all their life but they have never heard or experienced something like this before.

I break the pages and let the bees fly out.  Noxious  	No is the mind of the orphaned storm,  	Gravity of skin falling off in great sheets.  	They built this stealth weather wrought from faux organs  	Without a cloud to its breath.  	What they built was a winter in which to leave me.  	No is the yellow wing, rainspots  	On banana leaves as fingerprints of the dead.  	It is the wish to hunt ice when the blood learns  	The meaning of never.  	It is the rise inside  	A rooster’s crow, pretense of arms  	From a ragged shape made unwhole.  	The face is a mechanical cloth  	Tethered to the evocation of daylight.  	They stockpile the hours in  	Beds of the missing,  	In shattered vials gathered by the witnessing moon.   Orderly Wrap-Up of CBW Investigation  	There will be no wrap-up press releases; Washington has developed press guidance for use on an if-asked basis….

They shift their sails  	Away from my breathing. They tell me I am  	Not made of mirrors but from a wolf that slept  	In a grave and gave birth to a sunrise. She is  	The fruit that formed me, the dense coat of silk  	Shadowing me out of the ice. Sometimes I  	Dream in the voice of another empire, and  	I see its feet slink through the crosshairs,  	Clipping around shells and splinters of trapped  	Fires. Its ballroom caves ripple out murmurings  	Of the lost ones, despair mottling the dark as  	Small searchlights. Lost Ones, who linger  	Through a solar rage, I know your pain lives  	Cardinal. Love spills from your hallucinations.  	Once, a child whispered into me: such sorrow  	Can only be followed by a decade of snow.  	I crawled into the sky and wept a puddle  	Of sweet laurel until I bled at the ankles, until  	Grandmother called: come in from the winter.   The Shaman Asks about Yellow Rain  	Did the airplane knife the sky? Or did it arrive,  	Still and unruffled  	As a mass grave?  	Did it drone a foreign talk, tune of a soggy  	Friendship, or maybe  	It was lit from  	An acquainted hum? Did you look up to earth’s  	Tinted azure for one  	Terrific minute?  	What of the power, as if sand had been thrown  	In your face, as if innards  	Had been scheming  	To leave you. How long before your flesh slipped off?  	Did you hear distant  	Men chatter of their  	Armless nation, hoarding amputated limbs? Maybe  	The babbling entered in reverse,  	A camouflaged back  	Turned to you, the deletion of your death  	As more than collateral,  	Erasure of these toxins  	To prevent spilling of the globe’s intestines.  	Did you locate your way  	To the hills of lineage  	Without a guidesong to keep pace, without  	A ground to sleep you?  	How many decades  	Before you landed at the heirloom shore, jacketed  	Within flames of beige?  	Did you tell them of the  	Western rains, a speckled land that slipped into  	A canal and then  	Broke into downpour?  	Let them know. Let the ancient ones keen their oath  	Lyrics. Let them scrape each leaf,  	Each spoiled bark,  	Pieces of corroded lint, every spell of hemorrhaging.  	Let them one day utter  	The narrative uncloaked.   Refugee, Walking Is the Most Human of All  	So long to the papaya   kingdoms  	Of olden mothers,  	The shepherdess igniting  	Peels of bergamot.  	Grief of chalk  	Scribbles the form of an  	Archangel.  	Consider     a pillow of mortars,  	How the rubble of hair  	Weighs dense together  	With the pedestrian heft  	Of never coming back.  	Home is a sleeping whale.  	Consider an armor  	Of feathers, not to buffer      the body from shelling,  	But to be hoisted  	As a skyless meteor fleeing for  	An elsewhere chance  	To land.  	You will come back  	To rescue your footsteps.  	Towels spread on a road  	As if forming:    timeline  	Of cotton against  	A pillared topography.  	But this, the clap of hands in crisis  	Shoveling out evacuees.  	Empty your opera  	In the howling of the sea.   Revolt of Bees  	Recently, scientists have exploited the honey bees’ exceptional sense of smell… trained bees to detect the scent of various explosive materials…. [R]esearchers are exploring genetic and physiological differences between bees…. Ideally, a superior bee could be developed through genetic engineering…. Plans also include integrating very small fluidic devices to carry chemicals that could be delivered through the cyborgs’ sting.

I inherited yellow rain as I also inherited the lost. When my parents recalled what they knew about yellow rain, they did not speak of bees.

In all this, we were not losing a single American, and we were killing over thirty North Vietnamese a day. $500 million was what one US division cost us in South Vietnam. In Laos, the same sum enabled us to tie down two North Vietnamese divisions, numerous Binh Tram, plus many trucks and anti-aircraft artillery sites.
